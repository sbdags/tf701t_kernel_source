EDP DEBUGFS

1. Introduction

EDP debugfs root is at /sys/kernel/debug/edp. Manager and client objects
appear as subfolders under the root, forming a tree structure similar to
the EDP sysfs entries.

Following sections describe the debufs attributes. Unless stated
otherwise, all attributes have RW permissions.

2. EDP manager

	[1] cap: Peak current capacity - reading will return the present
	    value and writting will set a new cap. Note that the cap can
	    not be set lower than the sum of E0 currents of all clients.
	    Lowering the cap might result in throttling of clients.

	[2] status (read-only): Gives a snap shot of the manager and its
	    budget distribution.

3. EDP clients

Following is the list of common client attributes. The client driver may
add additional device specfic attributes under the same folder.

	[1] current: Force a certain client's E-state. Write the state
	    index to force the state. Read will return the state value.
	    The request is processed only if it can be handled fully
	    (that is, the client will not be assigned a lesser E-state).
	    If the state can not be changed due to insufficient budget,
	    the operation fails.  Note that this request may be
	    overriden by other requests. To prevent this from happening,
	    choose the debug policy governor (see the EDP governor
	    documentation).
