This test verifies the functionality of the OES_standard_derivatives extension, if it is available.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS WebGL context exists
Testing FRAGMENT_SHADER_DERIVATIVE_HINT_OES with extension disabled
PASS getError was expected value: INVALID_ENUM : FRAGMENT_SHADER_DERIVATIVE_HINT_OES should not be queryable if extension is disabled
PASS getError was expected value: INVALID_ENUM : hint should not accept FRAGMENT_SHADER_DERIVATIVE_HINT_OES if extension is disabled

Testing various shader compiles with extension disabled
PASS GL_OES_standard_derivatives not defined in shaders when extension disabled
PASS Shader built-ins disallowed without #extension pragma
PASS Shader built-ins failed to compile when extension disabled
PASS Successfully enabled OES_standard_derivatives extension
PASS OES_standard_derivatives listed as supported and getExtension succeeded
Testing FRAGMENT_SHADER_DERIVATIVE_HINT_OES with extension enabled
PASS ext.FRAGMENT_SHADER_DERIVATIVE_HINT_OES is 0x8B8B
PASS getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : FRAGMENT_SHADER_DERIVATIVE_HINT_OES query should succeed if extension is enabled
PASS Default value of FRAGMENT_SHADER_DERIVATIVE_HINT_OES is DONT_CARE
PASS getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : hint should accept FRAGMENT_SHADER_DERIVATIVE_HINT_OES
PASS Round-trip of hint()/getParameter() with all supported modes

Testing various shader compiles with extension enabled
PASS GL_OES_standard_derivatives defined in shaders when extension is enabled
PASS Shader built-ins disallowed without #extension pragma
PASS Shader built-ins compiled successfully when extension enabled
Testing various draws for valid built-in function behavior
PASS Draw 1 (no variation) returned the correct data
PASS Draw 2 (variation in x) returned the correct data
PASS Draw 3 (variation in y) returned the correct data
PASS Draw 4 (variation in x & y) returned the correct data
Testing that getExtension() returns the same object each time
PASS gl.getExtension("OES_standard_derivatives").myProperty is 2

PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
