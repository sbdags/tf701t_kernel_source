This test ensures WebGL implementations correctly clear the drawing buffer on composite if preserveDrawingBuffer is false.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS gl1 != null is true
PASS gl2 != null is true
PASS gl1.getContextAttributes().preserveDrawingBuffer == false is true
PASS gl2.getContextAttributes().preserveDrawingBuffer == false is true
